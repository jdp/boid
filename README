boid, io environment & package manager

basics

  % handles multiple environments
  % handles many types of packages
    - files
    - directories
    - scm checkouts

usage

  % packages
    $ boid install <package-spec>
    $ boid uninstall <package-spec>
    $ boid list
  
  % environments
    $ boid env create <name>
    $ boid env destroy <name>
    $ boid env use <name>
    $ boid env list
    $ boid env active

setup

  $ io setup.io
  $ boid check
  
todo

  % package boid as an addon. it's got the right directory structure, but
    i can't get io to recognize it
  % more intelligent setup script
  % package installation
  % official io has to respect IOIMPORT variable. i've submitted a patch,
    we'll see if it gets accepted
  % working with the file system is a pain in io. there is no command to
    make a whole directory tree, recursively delete directories, create
    symbolic links, expand paths, etc. until that happens, the active
    environment is marked by having a .active file in its directory and
    there are too many System system() calls for my liking
