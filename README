boid, io environment & package manager

basics

  % handles multiple environments
  % handles many types of packages
    - files
    - directories
    - scm checkouts

usage

  % packages
    $ boid install <package-spec>
    $ boid uninstall <package-spec>
    $ boid list
  
  % environments
    $ boid env create <name>
    $ boid env destroy <name>
    $ boid env use <name>
    $ boid env list
    $ boid env active

setup

  setting up io addons really is a pain, and hopefully in the future
  io will respect the IOIMPORT variable so boid won't have to be
  installed as an addon.

  first:
  	you need to install boid as an addon
  	$ cd /wherever/you/put/io/addons
  	$ git clone git://github.com/jdp/boid.git
  	$ mv boid Boid
  	$ cd ..
  	$ make addons
  	$ sudo make install
  	
  then:
    $ cd addons/Boid
    $ io setup.io
    # then copy bin/boid somewhere in your PATH
    $ boid check
  
todo

  % more intelligent setup script
  % package installation
  % official io has to respect IOIMPORT variable. i've submitted a patch,
    we'll see if it gets accepted
  % too many System system() calls for my liking. io really needs a
    clone of Ruby's FileUtils, i.e., rm_rf, ln_s, mkdir_p, readlink, etc.
